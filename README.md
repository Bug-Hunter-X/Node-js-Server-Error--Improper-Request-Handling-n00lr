# Node.js Server Error: Improper Request Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js server development: improper request handling.  The initial `server.js` file contains a basic server setup that doesn't gracefully handle various request types or errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes.

The `server-solution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling and more robust request processing.

## Bug Description

The original code creates a simple HTTP server that responds with 'Hello, World!' to all requests. However, it lacks error handling and doesn't differentiate between different HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.).  This makes it vulnerable to unexpected errors and inefficient in handling diverse requests.

## Solution

The solution implements more comprehensive error handling and distinguishes request methods. It uses `req.method` to check the request type and responds appropriately. Error handling is included to prevent the server from crashing due to unexpected issues.
